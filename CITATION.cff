  This lesson is about Interoperability in Climate Sciences.
  The main target audience are Researchers from the Climate
  and atmospheric science domains working with
  multidimensional datasets stored in NetCDF and  that they
  are interested that other researchers reuse their data and
  software. 

  After following this lesson, learners will be able to :


  - Recognize the importance of interoperability for data
  reuse 

  - Identify the key elements of interoperable data format

  - Explain when a NetCDF dataset is interoperable

  - Evaluate adherence of a NetCDF files to CF convention.

  - Access and analyse NetCDF files using OpenDAP and Python

  - Detect interoperability "holes" in a specific data
  format / data package
