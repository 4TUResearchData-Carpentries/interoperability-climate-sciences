## Understand the importance of interoperability for data reuse


::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

### Understand the importance of interoperability for data reuse

Make it a multiple choice (or transform it to think-pair-share to enable more discussions)
You have two datasets about ocean temperature — one in CSV format with unclear column names, and one in NetCDF format following CF conventions.
Which dataset would be easier to reuse and why?

A) CSV — because it’s a simple text file

B) NetCDF — because it follows shared conventions

C) Both are equally reusable

:::::::::solution

### Solution

B) NetCDF — because it follows shared conventions

::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

### True/False or Agree/Disagree with discussion afterwards 

- “As long as data are open access, they are interoperable.”
- “Metadata standards help ensure interoperability.”
- “As long as data is using an open standard format is interoperable” (hint to connect to the next section)

:::::::::solution

### Solution

F,T,F

:::::::::: keypoints

- Interoperability in the context of research data refers to the ability of systems, datasets, and tools to work together seamlessly.
- Interoperability can occur at multiple levels: technical(compatible formats), semantic(shared vocabularies), organizational (common policies),legal(licensing)
- etc.
