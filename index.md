This is a lesson about data interoperability in Climate Sciences.

## Lesson learning objectives 

- Recognize the importance of interoperability for data reuse 
- Identify the key elements of interoperable data format
- Explain when a NetCDF dataset is interoperable
- Evaluate adherence of a NetCDF files to CF convention.
 - Convert NetCDF file metadata so that it follows CF convention.
 - Access a NetCDF file using OpenDAP interface, via DAP protocol.
 - Access a NetCDF file programatically, using DAP protocol.
 - Analyse a NetCDF file programatically, using DAP protocol. [Python libraries]
 - Detect interoperability "holes" in a specific data format / data package 

*To Discuss*
- Convert non interoperable datasets into more interoperable ones 

 - Create a dataset in 4TU.ResearchData repository programatically, using a REST API. 
 - Upload a file to 4TU.ResearchData repository programatically, using a REST API.
