This lesson is about Interoperability in Climate Sciences.
   


## Target audience

This lesson is intended for researchers in the climate and atmospheric sciences who handle multidimensional NetCDF datasets and wish to make their data and software more reusable by others.

## Learning objectives 

By the end of this lesson, learners will be able to: 


- Recognize the importance of interoperability for data
  reuse 

- Identify the key elements of interoperable data format

- Explain when a NetCDF dataset is interoperable

- Evaluate adherence of a NetCDF files to CF convention.

- Access and analyse NetCDF files using OpenDAP and Python

- Detect interoperability "holes" in a specific data
format / data package




:::::: prereq

To follow this lesson, learners should already be able to have :

- Working knowledge in Python (write and execute short scripts in Python)
- Awareness of NetCDF format
